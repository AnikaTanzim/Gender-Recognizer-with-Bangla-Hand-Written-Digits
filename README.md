# Gender-Recognizer-with-Bangla-Hand-Written-Digits

Applying **logistic regression** and **Deep Neural Network** for the **Ekush** dataset and build a binary classification model that can predict  **male/female** from Bengali handwritten digits with different hyperparameter settings, we can see Deep Neural Network Model gives better accuracy and also states that we can use hand written digit to recognize gender.
